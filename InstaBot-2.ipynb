       "  '#TalkStreaming #RatatouilleA comic world in which a rat can become a chef and food can take on an almost unbearable sensuality. It’s time to revisit, our all time favorite feel-good movie, Ratatouille! Remy, a very unusual rat, who somehow in a lifetime of sorting through human garbage with his furry tribe, develops a taste for fresh and delicious food. And through a twist of fate, he winds up in the kitchen of a top-flight Parisian restaurant. Tantalizing the taste buds of even the most jaded customers, Remy pursues his dream of cooking despite the threat of being ratted out.Ratatouille sure does have the feels of those classic old cartoons that we used to watch in marathons during early mornings. 🎥 : @netflix_in 📸 : @wikipedia',\n",
